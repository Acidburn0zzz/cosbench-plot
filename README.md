cosbench-plot: plot utility for COSBench
========================================

cosbench-plot is a tool to analyze the statistics produced by COSBench (https://github.com/intel-cloud/cosbench) and create charts to compare different workstages and workloads.

NOTE: this tool is developed independently from COSBench.

Versions
--------

There are no releases at the moment other than the HEAD on the master branch!

Requirements
------------

 * Python >= 2.7
 * matplotlib for python: http://matplotlib.org/ (probably available in your distro repositories)

Usage
-----

At the moment, cosbench-plot is a Python library, so there is no CLI/GUI.
The intended usage entails writing some Python code to describe the charts that must be plotted.

For some usage examples, please check the examples package.

Some more user-friendly documentation will be available soon, in the meantime, please use the contact information if you are interested in using this sofwtare and need some help.
